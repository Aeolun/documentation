Upgrading your OpenReplay deployment to the latest version requires updating both your backend (instance) and tracker.

## Upgrade Backend

### Upgrade Backend (from v1.3.6 or prior)

Ensure you're on `v1.3.6`, if you're running a prior version of OpenReplay, then first update it to `v1.3.6`:
   
```bash 
# Copy/backup the current openreplay folder to _version-number
mv openreplay openreplay_v1.3.5
git clone https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay -b v1.3.6
cd openreplay/scripts/helm
# bash upgrade.sh <old openreplay path>
bash upgrade.sh ~/openreplay_v1.3.5
```

Once you're on `v1.3.6` then proceed with the below steps:

1. Copy/backup the current openreplay folder to `_version-number` like below:
   
  ```bash 
  mv openreplay openreplay_v1.3.6
  ```

2. Clone the new OpenReplay version. In this example we're upgrading to the latest available version:
   
  ```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay
  ```

3. Run the below script to automatically upgrade your `vars.yaml` to the new format:
  
  ```bash
  cd openreplay/scripts/helmcharts
  ansible localhost -m template -a "src=vars_template.yaml dest=vars.yaml" -e @~/openreplay_v1.3.6/scripts/helm/vars.yaml
  ```

4. Upgrade OpenReplay:

  ```bash
  cd openreplay/scripts/helmcharts
  helm ls -n app | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I{} helm uninstall {} -n app
  helm uninstall nginx-ingress -n nginx-ingress
  ./openreplay-cli -I
  ```
  
5. If you're using SSL generated by certbot.sh script
  ```
  cd openreplay/scripts/helmcharts
  cp -rf ~/site.* openreplay/files/
  ./openreplay-cli -I
  ```

5. Update `fromVersion` variable in `/openreplay/scripts/helmcharts/vars.yaml` to reflect the new version. As an example if you're moving from `v1.3.6` to `v1.4.0` then update the `fromVersion` like below:
  
  ```yaml
  fromVersion: "v1.4.0"
  ```

> **Note:** 
Manual overrides made to any service configuration file (i.e. `openreplay/scripts/helm/app/<app>.yaml`) will be reset. So if you have any custom overrides, like using an [external object storage service](/configuration/recordings-storage) for your recordings, or increased service capacity (cpu/memory), make sure to apply them to the new version (in `/openreplay/scripts/helmcharts/vars.yaml`) prior to running the upgrade script (step 4).

### Upgrade Backend (from v1.4.0 or higher)

1. Copy/backup the current openreplay folder to `_version-number` like below:
   
  ```bash 
  mv openreplay openreplay_v1.4.0
  ```

2. Clone the new OpenReplay version. In this example we're upgrading to the latest available version:
   
  ```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay
  ```

3. Upgrade OpenReplay:

  ```bash
  cd openreplay/scripts/helmcharts
  cp ~/openreplay_v1.4.0/scripts/helmcharts/vars.yaml .
  helm upgrade --install openreplay ./openreplay -n app --wait -f ./vars.yaml --atomic
  ```
  
4. If you're using SSL generated by certbot.sh script
  ```
  cd openreplay/scripts/helmcharts
  cp -rf ~/site.* openreplay/files/
  ./openreplay-cli -I
  ```

5. Update `fromVersion` variable in `/openreplay/scripts/helmcharts/vars.yaml` to reflect the new version. As an example if you're moving from `v1.4.0` to `v1.5.0` then update the `fromVersion` like below:
  
  ```yaml
  fromVersion: "v1.5.0"
  ```

### Upgrade Tracker

Ensure your tracker is compatible with the new backend version by checking the below compatibility table:

| Backend Version | Minimum Tracker Version |
|----------|-------------|
| v1.4.0 | 3.4.17 |
| v1.3.6 | 3.4.16 |
| v1.3.5 | 3.4.0 |
| v1.3.0 | 3.2.1 |
| v1.2.0 | 3.1.0 |
| v1.1.0 | 3.0.3 |
