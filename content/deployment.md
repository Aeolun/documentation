OpenReplay can be deployed anywhere. Here are step-by-step tutorials for deployment options using all the major cloud providers.

## Step-by-step guides

- [AWS](/deployment/deploy-aws)
- [Google Cloud](/deployment/deploy-gcp)
- [Azure](/deployment/deploy-azure)
- [Digital Ocean](/deployment/deploy-digitalocean)
- [Kubernetes](/deployment/deploy-kubernetes)

You can also deploy from source. Even though this method takes more effort, it gives a lot of flexibility as you can use the latest code and customize it if needed.

## CLI

OpenReplay CLI makes it easy to manage your instance by directly accessing logs, and restarting or reinstalling services. More details on the CLI [here](/deployment/openreplay-cli).
